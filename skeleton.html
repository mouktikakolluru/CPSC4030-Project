    <strong class="title">The Health Inequality Project</strong>

    <strong>
      <p>Background & Motivation <br>
        The focus of this project is to investigate the way that income inequality impacts people’s health. 
        A main motivator for choosing this project was our interest in the medical field. I (Elizabeth) am 
        a Bioengineering major and specialize in the design of medical devices. Because of this, I have prior 
        knowledge about the healthcare industry, but was interested in how income impacts life expectancy and 
        other medical outcomes. In addition, I (Mouktika) am from India and have seen so many people there 
        that live in unlivable conditions due to the fact that they can’t afford it, and as a consequence 
        their health is almost always in bad shape. During my visits to India, I’ve observed an increasing 
        number of people who struggle with low income and its effects. Because of this, I have a deep empathy 
        for them and wanted to explore and study more as to what exactly is affected, and this dataset diving 
        into the United States of America is a good starting point. Our combined interests made it extremely 
        easy to decide on this project, and we are looking forward to the discoveries we will make within this 
        study!
